# Client and Server Protocol for Surreal-Raft and SurrealDS

This project is split into 4 workspaces.

- Client, which involves connecting to SurrealDS
- Server, which resides on the SurrealDS or Surreal-Raft instances and accepts connections
- Common, for sharing data structures and common functionality
- Test, which ties the 2 protocols together
